## Adding a New Team

Teams live under `plugins/<name>-team/`. The minimum required layout is:

```
plugins/<name>-team/
├── .claude-plugin/
│   └── plugin.json          # plugin manifest (see below)
├── agents/                  # one .md file per agent
│   └── <name>-<role>.md
├── skills/                  # one directory per skill
│   └── <skill-name>/
│       └── SKILL.md
├── AGENTS.md                # human-readable agent catalog for this team
└── <name>.md                # harness entry-point (orchestration instructions)
```

### `plugin.json` manifest

```json
{
  "name": "<name>-team",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "One-sentence description of what the team does.",
  "agents": ["agents/<name>-<role>.md"],
  "skills": ["skills/<skill-name>/SKILL.md"]
}
```

### `AGENTS.md`

Document every agent: its role, inputs, outputs, and how it hands off to the next agent. Keep it concise — one paragraph per agent is enough.

### `<name>.md` (harness entry-point)

This file is the system-level instruction Claude Code receives when routing to the team. It should describe:

1. Team mission and orchestration pattern (Pipeline / Fan-out / Expert Pool / …)
2. Agent roster and call order
3. Handoff artifact format (e.g., `.claude/specs/<name>-<slug>.md`)

---

## Adding a New Agent

Create `plugins/<team>-team/agents/<team>-<role>.md`. The file must start with a YAML frontmatter block:

```markdown
---
name: <team>-<role>
description: "Concise description shown to Claude Code when selecting this agent."
model: sonnet          # sonnet (default) | opus (heavy orchestrators only)
---

# <team>-<role> — Short Title

Rest of the system prompt…
```

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Unique identifier, kebab-case. Must match the filename (without `.md`). |
| `description` | yes | One sentence. Used by the router to pick the right agent. |
| `model` | no | Defaults to `sonnet`. Use `opus` only for top-level orchestrators. |

Keep system prompts action-oriented. State what the agent **does**, what it **receives** (inputs), and what it **produces** (outputs/handoffs).

---

## Adding a New Skill

Create a directory under `plugins/<team>-team/skills/<skill-name>/` and add a `SKILL.md` file:

```markdown
---
name: <skill-name>
description: "One sentence describing when to invoke this skill."
user_invocable: true          # false if only called by agents
trigger_keywords: ["keyword1", "keyword2"]
---

# <skill-name>

Body: what the skill does, step by step.
```

**Frontmatter fields:**

| Field | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | yes | Kebab-case, matches directory name. |
| `description` | yes | Shown in the skill selector. Be specific about trigger conditions. |
| `user_invocable` | no | `true` means users can invoke via `/skill-name`. |
| `trigger_keywords` | no | Array of strings that help the router match the skill. |

## Local Development

```bash
# 1. Clone and install dependencies
git clone https://github.com/bssm-oss/harness-kit.git
cd harness-kit
npm install

# 2. Install the CLI globally (links to your local copy)
npm install -g .

# 3. After editing agents/skills, reinstall to pick up changes
npm install -g .

# 4. Verify the install
harness-kit --help
```

The installer copies `plugins/` into `~/.claude/`. After reinstalling, changes are live in any new Claude Code session.
